To run our code, you need :
- for each patient,
- rsFMRI data as a .nii file
- a file for the dlPFC mask, that you can find here
- a file for the sgACC mask (the send), that you can also find here
- For predictive outcome, you will also need to get an E-field map, as a .nii file, that you can get using simnibs.
