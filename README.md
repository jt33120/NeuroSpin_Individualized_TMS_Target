To run our code, you need :
- for each patient,
- rsFMRI data as a .nii file
- a file for the dlPFC mask, that you can find here
- a file for the sgACC mask (the send), that you can also find here
- For predictive outcome, you will also need to get an E-field map, as a .nii file, that you can get using simnibs.

You can found an example of time series, of dlPFC mask and sgACC seed mask (the ones found used in our study) tu try our pipeline at this address : https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/yrs0yjhlm9d9pg2r5z53t/AF9dGp2InM5jzRL283xvpws?rlkey=k5w61rymw62tf3eor0j3p9xmj&st=w775ubn2&dl=0
